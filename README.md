# BubbleBlast2 with Ncurses
Recreation of the game "BubbleBlast2 (PlayStore)" I made using the Ncurses library. 

Made for Linux x86_64 and ARM64.

## Functionality
The game completly recreates the interface from the above mentioned android game. The only new features that I added were made to make the iterface usable on a terminal, like pressing keyboards keys to start a new game, retry the current one or exit the game.

## Technologies used
- Completly written in C.
- Ncurses library that allows to draw on the terminal, used by many interactive terminal games.
